  * Don't exclude diff and mktemp in orphaner anymore.

 -- Carsten Hey <carsten@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Jun 2012 20:31:30 +0200

deborphan (1.7.28.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.

  This point release includes the remaining part of deborphan's multiarch
  support.  Versions up to 1.7.28.5 did only include checks to avoid printing
  false positives.  1.7.28.6 already handles architecture qualified input and
  contains the disabled code for architecture qualified output.  This release
  enables the architecture qualified output and strips architecture suffixes
  in dependencies (see below).

  * Enable remaining part of multiarch support:
    + Append architecture suffixes to package names if packages from more than
      one architecture besides 'all' are installed.  Package names printed by
      --list-keep do not contain architecture suffixes.  If adding package
      names with architecture suffixes to the keep file will ever be
      supported, --list-keep's output might contain architecture suffixes too.
      Closes: #658972, LP: #940379, LP: #951430
    + Strip architecture suffixes in dependencies.  This is due to the way
      deborphan currently works safe, even though the details of architecture
      qualified dependencies have not been completely specified yet.
    + Add options --show-arch and --no-show-arch to deborphan.  These options
      are documented in README.frontends and intended to be used by
      deborphan's frontends if they prefer the architecture suffixes to be
      printed either always or never.
    + Use deborphan's option --no-show-arch in editkeep and remove repeated
      package names from the output.

 -- Carsten Hey <carsten@debian.org>  Sun, 13 May 2012 23:42:56 +0200

deborphan (1.7.28.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.

  [ David Prévot ]
  * Update Uploaders address.
  * Fix typo in French --guess-doc option help. Closes: #635771

  [ Martin Kourim ]
  * Accept the options --ignore-suggests and --ignore-recommends in
    orphaner. Closes: #638906

  [ Carsten Hey ]
  * Bump standards version to 3.9.3.1.
  * Prepare printing architecture suffixes, but don't do so yet because
    synaptic expects deborphan to never print architecture suffixes.
  * Understand, or, if appropriate, strip, architecture suffixes all around.
  * Do not simulate running apt-get in orphaner before really running it.
    This test would be a mess to adapt to multiarch, and, due to other checks,
    it wasn't needed anyway.
  * Imply --force-hold in show-deps mode. Closes: #670652
  * Minor bug fixes and cleanups in src/keep.c.  Due to usage of getline(),
    this release won't compile on a decade old system anymore.
  * Add file /usr/share/doc/deborphan/README.frontends.  This file contains
    information that is only considered to be useful for deborphan's
    frontends.
  * Adapt old debian/changelog entry introducing --check-options to be more
    vague.  Doing this before it makes any sense to use this option in
    a deborphan frontend eases introducing more advanced ways of checking the
    availability of options in future.  The new file README.frontends contains
    the complete specification of this option.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to deborphan's Depends: line in debian/control.
  * Add set -e to maintainer scripts and remove -e from their shebang line.

 -- Carsten Hey <carsten@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Apr 2012 21:44:07 +0200

  * Catalan (Jordi Mallach). Closes: #606890

 -- Carsten Hey <c.hey@web.de>  Sun, 12 Dec 2010 21:22:17 +0100

deborphan (1.7.28.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Exclude diff and mktemp from being displayed in orphaner.  Apt and dpkg
    sometimes disagree about essentialness of packages, which leads to
    failures for dpkg frontends that use apt to remove packages, e.g.,
    deborphan.  Currently, the relevant packages are diff and mktemp.  The
    package install-info has deliberately not been added to the list of to be
    excluded packages.
  * Don't let --guess-section display the following packages as possible
    orphans:
    - Packages ending with -bin, -tools or -utils  Closes: #579139
    - PAM libraries  Closes: #516487
    - Ubuntu dbgsym packages  LP: #533881
    - Mono and Ruby libraries
  * Adapt regular expression for detecting transitional packages to prevent
    some packages with unfortunate short descriptions to be wrongly matched as
    possible orphans.
  * Add additional options to be used by deborphan frontends:
    --all-packages-pristine: same as -a, except that its output format will
      not change in future
    --print-guess-list: print available guess options
    --check-options: check if an other given option is supported by this
      deborphan version and exit with 0 if it is.

deborphan (1.7.28) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Andrej Tatarenkow ]
  * Fix parsing of /var/lib/deborphan/keep so that it does not need a final
    newline.  (Closes: #446533)

  [ Carsten Hey ]
  * Fix parsing of --no-show-section.  (Closes: #507574)
  * Handle Mono libraries like other special libraries, e.g. Perl or Python
    ones and add --guess-mono as option.  (Closes: #402992)
  * Add option --guess-kernel.
  * Refactor guessing algorithm. Also improve guessing ruby libraries and
    guessing packages which are placed in the wrong section.
  * Add option --no-guess-*.  (Closes: #387594)
  * Add options --ignore-suggests and --ignore-recommends. When both options
    are used together, deborphan behaves as if the nice-mode has been turned
    off.  (Closes: #488329)
  * Add option --show-deps-pristine. This option should be used by other
    programs that use deborphan instead of --show-deps since the output of the
    latter will change in the future.
  * Fix some splint warnings, including a typo which was probably introduced
    during refactoring many years ago and broke debfoster support.
  * Fix some typos in debian/changelog, thanks to Paul Menzel.
    (Closes: #495413)
  * Don't run apt-get in orphaner when the to be used status file was
    explicitly specified.
  * Remove the separator line from the package list whilst simulating removing
    packages in orphaner.
  * Add option --skip-apt to orphaner.
  * Abort orphaner when -c oder --find-circular is passed as option.  These
    options will be added to deborphan 1.7.29 but initially not be supported
    by orphaner.
  * Clarify the meaning of -R in the output of deborphan --help.
    (Closes: #497651)
  * Don't ignore errors in the maintainer scripts.

    detailed bug report.  (Closes: #495818)
  * Add new Italian translation.  Thanks to Alessandro De Zorzi.

  * Clarify documentation of --force-hold.  (Closes: #429584)
  * Document listing all uninstalled packages in README.  (Closes: #389684)
  * Arrange items in deborphan(1) and src/exit.c alphabetically for faster
    lookup.  (Closes: #365276)
  * Check if apt-get tries to remove more packages than requested by orphaner.
    (Closes: #478154)
  * Remove versioned dependency on bash.
  * Move dialog to Recommends.  (Closes: #459823)
  * Move gettext-base to Recommends.  Orphaner now prints the English message
    if gettext-base is not installed.  (Closes: #287971)
  * Better error handling in orphaner.  Print apt-get commandline if apt is
    not installed, broken dependencies are found or lock file could not be
    opened.  (Closes: #267629)
  * Remove the separator line from the to be removed packages in orphaner.
  * Fix copy and paste error in gettext message APT_GET_REMOVED.
  * Disable printing of to be removed packages in orphaner, after it has been
    fixed.  I didn't work in past versions, so nobody will miss this feature.
  * Remove lintian override for menu-command-not-in-package.  Current lintian
    does not need this anymore.
  * Don't fail in postrm if the admin created a file in $KEEPDIR.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3.
  * Use debian/compat instead of DH_COMPAT and switch to level 5.
  * Don't ignore errors in make clean.
  * Move menu item from section Apps/System/Admin to
    Applications/System/Administration.
  * Add Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser fields.

deborphan (1.7.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Whitespace cleanup in orphaner (closes: #398330).
  * Change a 'function sigwinch_handle' into 'sigwinch_handle()' in orphaner.
  * Remove some noise in the basename check or orphaner that was probably
    introduced by vi editing.  Orphaner didn't work when called as
    orphaner.sh.
  * Fix an (unfiled) important bug when using editkeep.  Regardless of
    the previous state of the keepfile, we completely clear it when the
    user selects cancel, or dialog terminates for some other reason, like
    the window getting too small.

deborphan (1.7.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow dots in package names after python and pike if their
    respective --guess option is used.  Now we match python2.3-*
    too (closes: #349719).
  * Change a typo in the orphaner license:  "at your opinion" is
    supposed to be "at your option".
  * Prompt the user to press return after running apt-get so they
    can investigate any warnings that apt might have printed
    (closes: #351492).
  * Return from sstrsep() if we do not find the token we were looking
    for.  This closes a bug where we would screw up our keep file
    in some circumstances (closes: #334720).
  * Change autogen.sh to use aclocal-1.9 and automake-1.9 instead of
    their 1.7 versions.
  * New autotools left us with a new config.h.in.
  * Add mkinstalldirs to svn and Makefile.am's EXTRA_DIST.  New auto*
    no longer gives it to us but our gettext needs it.
  * Also ship autogen.sh in tarball for good measure.
  * Ignore cases where a package depends on itself (closes: #366028).
  * Fix documentation of -d.  It does list all packages, orphaned or
    not (closes: #334894).
  * Use backticks instead of xargs in the README: deborphan | xargs apt-get
    --remove becomes apt-get --remove `deborphan`.  This is so that stdin
    is still available to the user to say yes to apt-get asking stuff
    (closes: #355148).
  * Document -n in editkeep.8 manpage.  Also change the title of the
    manpage from orphaner to editkeep.  Part of the kitchen-sink patch
    in #343241.
  * Interpunction fixes in deborphan.1 manpage.  From patch in #343241.
  * Add Polish translation of manpages from #343241.
  * Update french translation of manpages from #343241.
  * Updates to the build system of manpages from #343241.
  * Add Polish translation of programs (closes: #343241).
  * Add Basque translation of programs (closes: #374969).
  * Change Standards-Version from 3.6.2 to 3.7.2.  No additional changes
    required.
  * Change menu file to call su-to-root without path.  Previously it
    called it as /usr/sbin/so-to-root, but su-to-root has since moved
    to /usr/bin.
  * Update copyright statement all around.  It's 2006 now.

  * Make sure that even with section names that are very long (i.e.
    broken) we always separate the section and the package name with
    at least one space (closes: #328886).
  * Increase standards version from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2 - no changes needed.
  * Minor whitespace change in menu file.
  * Add a lintian override for menu-command-not-in-package.  We
    call orphaner with an argument (-a) which confuses lintian.
  * Add the file provided by Jens Nachtigall <nachtigall@web.de> to
    /etc/bash_completion.d/ (closes: #321934).
  * Slightly change spacing in deborphan.1 manpage - this was also
    part of Julien Louis' patch.
  * Add French translation of manpages by Julien Louis <ptitlouis@sysif.net>,
    using po4a (closes: #320243).

  * Refactor handling of exclude list. Previously there was a fixed limit
    of 64 excludes, which can easily be reached when using orphaner's

    hook which installs keep file.
  * A non existing keep file when running --zero-keep is just fine.
  * If the keep file does not exist, just print an empty list in --list-keep.
  * Use svn revision as version number in orphaner.

deborphan (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Take over upstream maintainership of deborphan, give it a new version, and
    make it a debian native package.
    closes: #238300: no reliable way to detect exact version
  * Install NEWS file as changelog-old now, current changelog is
    kept in debian/changelog.
    closes: #238157: help doesn't save selection
  * set LANG to C for sort in orphaner, so it sorts correctly.
    closes: #238370: Mixed sort order if LANG is set
  * Remove all files created from autoconf from the repository.
    But use a make dist'd tarball for uploads.
  * Remove magic in debian/rules to copy in current config.{sub,guess}.
    We are now our own upstream and autogen/make dist copies in new
    files every time.
  * Depend on dialog now.  Orphaner has developed into a very important
    piece of the package.  And dialog does not depend on an unreasonable
    amount of packages.
    closes: #228871 Please conflict with dialog versions which are too old
  * Joerg Sommer:
    - Extend copyright for 2004 on orphaner
    - (orphaner) remember selection in some simulate/help combination.
    - (orphaner) Replaced variable DEBORPHAN with "deborphan"
    - (orphaner) Moved evaluation of --df-keep option for deborphan to
      editkeep, because it's only needed there.
    - (orphaner) changed minimum terminal size to 50x12
    - (orphaner) installed handler for signal SIGWINCH, which recalculate
      the size of dialog when the terminal size has changed.
      closes: #243899 Does not honour window resizing
      Note that it is not possible to resize the current dialog, but as soon
      as one of the buttons is pressed - i.e. when we start a new dialog -
      the user will get new sizes.
    - (orphaner) rewrote main part to make the code more understandable and
      cleaner
    - (orphaner) some little code cleanups: () -> {}, indentions
  * Added german translation made by Florian Ernst <florian@uni-hd.de>.
    closes: #243978 deborphan: German l10n
  * Move standards-version to 3.6.1.  No changes needed.
  * Update copyright notices in deborphan and debian/copyright.
  * Update dates in manpages.
  * Minor update of the nl translation.

deborphan (1.5-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Orphaner improvements by Joerg Sommer:
    o fix strange behaviour with simulation where user selections got lost
      (closes: #224750).
    o Take advantage of the new --defaultno and --help-status
      options of dialog and removes the eval call (closes: #224748).
      Therefore make the Recommends on dialog versioned: >= 0.9b-20031207-1
    o Minor cleanup:
      - let replaced by $(()) or test (latter are common practice).
      - check for deborphan with which; so deborphan can be anywhere in the
        $PATH -- the variable DEBORPHAN can be replaced by "deborphan".
      - if you mark all packages for simulation, orphaner tells in the next run
        "there are no orphaned packages" -- this is fixed.
    Thanks Joerg.

deborphan (1.5-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reference cruft(8) in deborphan(1) manpage (closes: #220203).
  * Add --guess-doc option, which searches for .*-doc package names
    (closes: #204667).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Nov 2003 14:49:47 +0100

deborphan (1.5-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refactor handling of dependencies and provides in the pkg_info
    datastructure.  Previously there were fixed limits of 128 and 20
    respectively.  Now we use a dynamically allocated list which starts out at
    32 and 4, if needed at all, and which are doubled in size should the need
    arise (closes: #219457).
  * Replace all bar = malloc(strlen(foo)+1); bar = strcpy(bar,foo) with uses
    of strdup: bar = strdup(foo);  Similarily to the previously defined
    xmalloc, which wraps around alloc and error()s out if malloc returns with
    an error, we now have an xstrdup with the same semantics.
  * Since sizeof(char) is 1 by definition there is no need to multply string
    sizes and similar with sizeof(char).  Removed all of them or replaced them
    by 1.
  * Initialize the first package information ("this") in deborphan.c.  The
    value appears to have used uninitialized.  Valgrind turned this up.
  * There was an off-by-one error in file.c debopen(), when null terminating
    the read status file.  We nullified buf[len+1] rather than buf[len], thus
    overflowing the buffer.  This also was found with valgrind.

deborphan (1.5-13) unstable; urgency=low

deborphan (1.5-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use single quotes rather than double quotes in commands in the menu
    file, as XML based menus break on escaped double quotes.
    (closes: #216010).
  * Orphaner now handles removal of deborphan, by checking whether
    deborphan still exists after apt-get.  If it does not, we
    say so and exit successfully.  (closes: #215912).
  * Change NUM_OPTIONS from a manual define to the last element of
    the enum in include/deborphan.h.  This will hopefully avoid
    bugs like #217790 and #181311 in the future.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Oct 2003 15:26:23 +0100

deborphan (1.5-11) unstable; urgency=low

    - Minor syntax changes
  * Change description of --show-deps in the manpage slightly.
  * Change touching all the files during the build process
    to reference an existing file (po/Makefile) so that all
    the files have the very same fine-grained timestamp.
    (closes: 216369: FTBFS with 2.6 kernels)

    after two rounds (Joerg Sommer).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Sun, 12 Oct 2003 22:11:20 +0200

deborphan (1.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to Joerg Sommer who contributed greatly to this
    release.  Most of the orphaner fixes are done by him.
  * orphaner now requires dialog, whiptail isn't good enough
    (closes: #185095).
  * deborphan also looks in libdevel now (closes: #201538).
    Thanks Matt Kraai.
  * guess-dummy also looks for "transition" packages, not only
    for "transitional" (closes: #210551).
  * add size information to deborphan output with -z.
    Patch by Richard Braakman. (closes: #189827).
  * Adapt orphaner windows to terminal size. (closes: #183816).
    Based on patch by Jan Hudec.
  * Guess-data also seaches for -music packages. (closes: #183646).
  * Fix deborphan -R acting like deborphan -Z.  Turns out there was
    some screwup with operator precedence.  (closes: #184949).
  * Now deborphan supports exclusion of packages by evaluation.
    (closes: #206478)
  * Updated orphaner to support the exclusion option of deborphan and
    simulate with this the removing of packages. (closes: #206410,#202986)
  * Orphaner greatly improved (much work done by Joerg Sommer):
    - Uses "Help" button to show package description (closes: #158757).
    - Better error handling; prints a message if deborphan, apt-get or
      $DIALOG exits with non-zero exit code
    - Separator only shown if there is something to separate
      (closes: #187476).
  * Read packages to keep from stdin rather than using xargs in
    orphaner/editkeep (closes: #182734: deborphan: editkeep can't handle long
    list of packages).

    deborphan -Z.
    closes: #181311: prelink breaks deborphan
  * Improved orphaner version by Joerg Sommer.
    It shows new packages at the top and is 99.99% posix. It's faster too.
    I've changed the shebang to be /bin/bash.
    closes: #176424, thanks Joerg!

deborphan (1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Have a -Z switch for deborphan which zeroes the keep file.
    (closes: #153397: deborphan -L | xargs deborphan -R does not work)
    - Also fixes the problem, that editkeep did not pass all options
      to all deborphan calls.

    (closes: #153519: orphaner doesn't accept deborphan flags like -guess-all)
  * strstripchr() in src/string.c was broken when the character to remove
    was not in the string. Fixed. This bug was not related with fixing #153319
    in 1.2-2 as the submitter guessed.

  * Have all applied patches in debian/applied-patches for reference.

    | --guess-interpreters.  Both pike and python have optional version
    | numbers in the file name so the regex has ([[:digit:]])? to
